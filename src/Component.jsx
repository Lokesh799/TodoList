       Functional components are some of the more common components that <hr/>
       will come across while working in React. These are simply JavaScript <hr/>
       functions. We can create a functional component to React by writing a JavaScript <hr/>
       function. These functions may or may not receive data as parameters. In the functional <hr/>
       Components, the return value is the JSX code to render to the DOM tree</p>
